# PlayMeAMessage
Using Spotify's Web API, this web app creates a playlist for you with song titles that spell out whatever message you enter.

## How to Run the App Locally
In a directory of your choosing, enter ``` git clone https://github.com/seoamy/PlayMeAMessage.git```

```cd``` into the directory

``` cd client ```

``` yarn ``` to install all dependencies for the client-side

``` yarn start ``` and open **http://localhost:3000/**

open a new tab on your terminal and ``` cd server ```

``` yarn ``` to install all dependencies for the server

``` node server.js ``` so that express is now listening on port 8888!
